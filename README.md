### Hi there 👋

I analyze data to understand the world around me. I speak for numbers and imbue them with meaning. I also enjoy having deep enlightening conversations with influential people on my podcast “Hayah AKtar”.

I am a graduate of the **faculty of engineering, Aerospace Department**, at Cairo university. I started my career before graduating out of college, by working as **the youngest "*Thinking Into Results*" program faciliatior** in the world. Few years later, I founded my own startup "*Increase*", and hosted "*Hayah Aktar*" podcast, which is one the most listened to podcasts in the Arab world.

In the beginning of 2020, shortly after Covid broke into Egypt, I started teaching myself software development. I studied *Algorithms & Data Structures*, and wrote code in *Python*. I solved hundreds of problems on *LeetCode*. I discovered my passion for working with and analyzing data, so I started learning **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.
